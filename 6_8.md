<Ch.6-Ex.8> Using merge, define a function msort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] that implements merge sort, 
in which the empty list and singleton lists are already sorted, and any other list is sorted by 
merging together the two lists that result from sorting the two halves of the list separately.
Hint: first define a function halve :: [a] -> ([a],[a]) that splits a list into two halves whose
lengths differ by at most one.

       putStrLn "unsorted list = 5, 9, 8, 7, 6, 10"
       putStr "sorted list = "
       print (msort [5,9,8,7,6,10])
       putStrLn "unsorted list = 10, 8, 7, 6, 9, 11, 22, 5, 8, 6"

Running the program grom ghci:
```cmd
unsorted list = 5, 9, 8, 7, 6, 10
sorted list = [5,6,7,8,9,10]
unsorted list = 10, 8, 7, 6, 9, 11, 22, 5, 8, 6
sorted list = [5,6,6,7,8,8,9,10,11,22]
```

The msort function divides the initial list into 2 list
which have roughly the same length, then it sorts them recursively
until it reaches the fundamental cases, afterwards it goes up the stack and starts
reassembling the partially sorted lists using the merge function.
