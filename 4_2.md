<Ch.4-Ex.2> SDefine a function third :: [a] -> a that returns the third element in a list that 
contains at least this many elements using:
a. head and tail;
b. list indexing !!;
c. pattern matching
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-}

-- third elem using head and tail
third_v1 :: [a] -> a
third_v1 list = head (tail (tail list))

-- third elem using list indexing
third_v2 :: [a] -> a
third_v2 list = list !! (2)

-- third elem using list pattern matching - version 1
third_v3 :: [a] -> a
third_v3 (x : y : z : _) = z

-- third elem using list pattern matching - version 2
third_v4 :: [a] -> a
third_v4 (_ : _ : z : _) = z

-- main
main = do
       let val1 = third_v1 [1,2,4,7,9]
       print val1
       let val2 = third_v2 [1,2,4,7,9]
       print val2
       let val3 = third_v3 [1,2,4,7,9]
       print val3
       let val4 = third_v4 [1,2,4,7,9]
       print val4
```

Running the program grom ghci:
```cmd       
*Main> :main
4
4
4
4
```
The third function has been rewritten in 3 different versions.
The first 2 don't make use of any new concepts, however version 3
performs pattern matching using a wildcard (_ is similar with *) on a list.
What's worth pointing out is that after z, anything can pop up
from our list.
