Running from ghci:
```cmd       
*Main> :main
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[12,14,16,18,20]
[12,14,16,18,20]
[2,4]
[2,4]
```

The mymapv1 function applies a procedure on an entire collection, and myfilterv1
extracts the elements from a list which satisfy a certain criteria. These 2 functions
have also been defined using foldr (using lambda expressions) which magically resolves 
the recursive calls.
