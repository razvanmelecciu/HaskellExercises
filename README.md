# HaskellExercises
A bunch of Haskell exercises from [Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell - 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229).
It seems that functional programming can really bring in some perspective into a programmer's life ðŸ˜‰.
Used [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (and the Haskell plugins) which integrates pretty well with ghci.
